X-Wing Cards
============

Just a little bit of code that builds a list of pilot and upgrade cards from a set of bought boxes.

I created it because all of my pilot and upgrade cards were stolen and I wanted to give FFG a complete list. Probably extensible with a bit of refactoring for a collection management tool of sorts.
